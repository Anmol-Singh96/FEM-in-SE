### History of FEM

#### Origins in Structural Analysis (1940s–1950s)

- Early Roots: The origins of FEM can be traced back to classical structural analysis methods like
the Direct Stiffness Method and Matrix Structural Analysis used for solving truss, beam, and
frame structures. These methods allowed for more efficient calculations for complex structures.
- Initial Breakthrough: The formal development of FEM began in the 1940s when the need for more
advanced computational methods arose, particularly in the field of aerospace engineering. The
engineers in this field needed methods to analyze the stress and strain of aircraft structures
under various loading conditions.
- Courant (1943): One of the earliest formal works on FEM is credited to [Richard Courant](put.link.here),
who used piecewise polynomial functions to solve torsion problems, laying the foundation for the
method of dividing a problem into small elements.
- John Argyris and Ray Clough (1950s): 
   - In the 1950s, John Argyris and Ray Clough further developed the method by applying it to
   solve structural analysis problems. 
   - Ray Clough, in his 1960 paper, coined the term `Finite Element Method` and demonstrated
   its application to structural engineering problems, specifically in the analysis of plates
   and shells.

#### Growth and Acceptance (1960s–1970s)

- Rapid Development: Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, FEM rapidly evolved, particularly due to advancements
in computer technology. With faster computers, engineers could handle the large-scale matrix operations
required by FEM.
- Civil Engineering Adoption: During this period, civil engineers began to adopt FEM for analyzing and
designing complex structures such as tall buildings, bridges, and dams. It allowed them to model complex
loadings, complex boundary conditions, and complex material behavior that were not possible with classical
methods.
- Commercial Software Development: In the late 1970s, FEM became more accessible to practicing engineers
with the development of commercial software tools like ANSYS and Nastran. These tools provided a
user-friendly interface for applying FEM to practical engineering problems.

#### Modern Era (1980s–Present)

- Computational Power: The availability of powerful computers in the 1980s made it possible to solve
large, three-dimensional FEM problems quickly and accurately. This greatly expanded the method's use
in civil and structural engineering.
- Advanced Applications: Today, FEM is used not only for static structural analysis but also for
dynamic analysis, seismic analysis, wind engineering, soil-structure interaction, and nonlinear
analysis. The method is used to simulate the behaviour of structures under complex loading conditions,
including earthquakes, wind, and other environmental factors.
