## Determining the approximate value of pi (π) using disretisation approach.

### Objectives:
1. Understand the application of the finite element method (FEM) in approximating the value of π.
2. Derive the expressions for the upper and lower bounds of π using geometric properties of inscribed and circumscribed polygons.
3. Calculate and compare these bounds for different numbers of sides (N) of the polygons.
4. Visualize the results to understand how increasing the number of sides affects the bounds.

### Deliverables:

1. Completed Table: Include values for \( N = 3 \), \( N = 4 \), and \( N = 5 \).
2. Sketches: Illustrations of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons.
3. Explanation: Brief explanation of the process and how increasing \( N \) affects the bounds.
