1. What are the differences between the analytical and numerical methods of structural analysis?

A human being is very strong in logical and analytical thinking but very weak in calculation speed (Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) which is why naturally we go for analytical solutions. A Computer on the other hand is very strong in calculation speed but very weak in analytical thinking, as a result, it is natural for computers to come up with solutions that are easy and logical but require a lot of calculations. These types of solutions are called numerical methods. As computers cannot think, these types of numerical solutions are devised for computers by humans.

2. What are the fundamental principles employed in the analysis of indeterminate structure?

To solve an indeterminate structure it is necessary to satisfy the equilibrium, compatibility and force-displacement requirements of the structure.[1] The additional equations required to solve indeterminate structure are obtained by the conditions of compatibility and/or force-displacement relations. The number of additional equations required to solve an indeterminate structure is known as degree of indeterminacy. Based on the types of unknown, a structure can be termed as statically indeterminate or kinematically indeterminate.

The following methods are used to solve indeterminate structures:

.Flexibility method
.Slope deflection method
.Moment distribution method
.Direct stiffness method

3. Solve a 2D portal with one beam and two columns left hand is fixed and the right is hinged with and UDL of 50KN/m. the top left joint has a horizontal force of 200KN height of the frame is 5m and a span is 4m. MOI of the beam is 1.5 times that of the column grade of concrete M30. Any missing data may be assumed. solve by using the element approach and stiffness approach
